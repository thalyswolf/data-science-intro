### Hi guys 😃
So, I developed some data science algorithms while I did study Data Science in a Udemy's Course.

### What will you find here ? 😯
1. This repository have some examples of how to do charts in Python. 📊
2. Algorithms for to analyze the Brazilian population growth. 📈
3. Algorithm for to compare Human genome and bactery genom 👨🏻‍💼 🦠
4. A little bioinformatics 🚀

### Brazilian population growth
Analysis is done through public data provided by DataSUS and the algorithm to analyze data of brazilian population is done from 1980 until 2016.
